# BGS

Renammed BGS to CGS (Clossi Go Server) as I'm not sure what direction this server will take and I can always change the name later. Right now this will be my hobby and CGS will make it so I can put whatever I want into the server until it becomes something on it's own. I still want to make it beginner friendly though.

IMPORTANT!! For those who want to download and test builds from GitHub or even help develop, PLEASE change the version type. If you need help with this, message me on Discord. If you do not do this, it can effect my debug testing and slow down the build process. I appreciate all help, but please change the version before changing anything or testing anything while I am working on it.

The Beginner Go Server is a project that I've been working on as a hobby. But it wasn't until 2019 that I actually said, I'm getting something out!! So I sat down and produced Capture Go! v0.1 of BGS. The original intent of this server was to make more Go variants possible to play online. For example, One Color Go, Capture Go, Blind Go, and much more. However, I started playing with the idea of how I would do the rating systems, especially for Territory Go, and I thought I could make this server beginner friendly as well as have a bunch of mini-games on it. Thus! We have come up with the Beginner Go Server. A place to play online for Beginners and others who want to try out new ways of playing Go. 

While I do plan on adding in a rating system for territory Go, the primary focus of the server will be to let players have fun and to help beginners who might stop by.

As of January 2019, my plans for v0.2 and 0.3 are to get out an Achievement system to increase activiy and a Tsumego solving setup. Time trials, challenges, ect... Territory Go will likely come after that with the addition of ratings. The tsumego features was upon request. Apparently Chess sites have something similar and people want Go time trials. xD

Features or goals I would like to see in the server are as follows in no particular order.

Capture Go
Territory Go
Rating System 
Board size adjust to rating for beginners 
Tsumego Time Trials
